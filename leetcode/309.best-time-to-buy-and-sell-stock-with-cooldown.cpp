 * Medium (42.06%)
 * Total Accepted:    60.7K
 * Total Submissions: 144.3K
 * Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3,0,2]'
 *
 * Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given
 * stock on day i.
 *
 * Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many
 * transactions as you like
 * (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the
 * following restrictions:
 *
 *
 * ⁠   You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you
 * must sell the stock before you buy again).
 * ⁠   After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on next day. (ie,
 * cooldown 1 day)
 *
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * prices = [1, 2, 3, 0, 2]
 * maxProfit = 3
 * transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]
 *
 *
 * Credits:Special thanks to @dietpepsi for adding this problem and creating
 * all test cases.
