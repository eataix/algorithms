#
# Given the running logs of n functions that are executed in a nonpreemptive
# single threaded CPU, find the exclusive time of these functions. 
# 
# Each function has a unique id, start from 0 to n-1. A function may be called
# recursively or by another function.
# 
# A log is a string has this format : function_id:start_or_end:timestamp. For
# example, "0:start:0" means function 0 starts from the very beginning of time
# 0. "0:end:0" means function 0 ends to the very end of time 0. 
# 
# Exclusive time of a function is defined as the time spent within this
# function, the time spent by calling other functions should not be considered
# as this function's exclusive time. You should return the exclusive time of
# each function sorted by their function id.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# Input:
# n = 2
# logs = 
# ["0:start:0",
# ⁠"1:start:2",
# ⁠"1:end:5",
# ⁠"0:end:6"]
# Output:[3, 4]
# Explanation:
# Function 0 starts at time 0, then it executes 2 units of time and reaches the
# end of time 1. 
# Now function 0 calls function 1, function 1 starts at time 2, executes 4
# units of time and end at time 5.
# Function 0 is running again at time 6, and also end at the time 6, thus
# executes 1 unit of time. 
# So function 0 totally execute 2 + 1 = 3 units of time, and function 1 totally
# execute 4 units of time.
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# Input logs will be sorted by timestamp, NOT log id.
# Your output should be sorted by function id, which means the 0th element of
# your output corresponds to the exclusive time of function 0.
# Two functions won't start or end at the same time.
# Functions could be called recursively, and will always end.
